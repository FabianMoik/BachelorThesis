%%%% Basic settings
%% ========================================================================
%% (idea of using newcommands for basic documentclass settings from: Thomas Schlager)

\newcommand{\mypapersize}{A4}
%% e.g., "A4", "letter", "legal", "executive", ...
%% The size of the paper of the resulting PDF file.

\newcommand{\mylaterality}{oneside}
%% "oneside" or "twoside"
%% Either you are creating a document which is printed on both, left pages
%% and right pages (twoside) or you create a document which is printed
%% on right pages only (oneside).

\newcommand{\mydraft}{false}
%% "true" or "false"
%% Use draft mode? If true, included graphics are replaced by empty
%% rectangles (of same size) and overfull boxes (in margin space) are
%% marked with black box (-> easy to spot!)

\newcommand{\myparskip}{half}
%% e.g., "no", "full", "half", ...
%% How to separate paragraphs: indention ("no") or spacing ("half",
%% "full", ...).

\newcommand{\myBCOR}{0mm}
%% Inner binding correction. This value depends on the method which is
%% being used to bind your printed result. Some techniques do not
%% require a binding correction at all ("0mm"), other require for
%% example "5mm". Refer to KOMA script documentation for a detailed
%% explanation what a binding correction is and how to measure it.

\newcommand{\myfontsize}{12pt}
%% e.g., 10pt, 11pt, 12pt
%% The font size of the main text in pt (points).

\newcommand{\mylinespread}{1.5}
%% e.g., 1.0, 1.5, 2.0
%% Line spacing in %/100. For example 1.5 means 150% of the usual line
%% spacing. Please use with caution: 100% ("1.0") is fine because the
%% font was designed for it.

\newcommand{\mylanguage}{ngerman,american}
%% "english,ngerman", "ngerman,english", ...
%% NOTE: The *last* language is the active one!
%% See babel documentation for further details.

%% BibLaTeX-settings: (see biblatex reference for further description)
\newcommand{\mybiblatexstyle}{authoryear}
%% e.g., "alphabetic", "authoryear", ...
%% The biblatex style which is being used for referencing. See
%% biblatex documentation for further details and more values.
%%
%% CAUTION: if you change the style, please check for (in)compatible
%%          "biblatex" package options in the file
%%          "template/preamble.tex"! For example: "alphabetic" does
%%          not have an option "dashed=..." and causes an error if it
%%          does not get removed from the list of options.

\newcommand{\mybiblatexdashed}{false}  %% "true" or "false"
%% If true: replace recurring reference authors with a dash.

\newcommand{\mybiblatexbackref}{true}  %% "true" or "false"
%% If true: create backward links from reference to citations.

\newcommand{\mybiblatexfile}{references-biblatex.bib}
%% Name of the biblatex file that holds the references.

\newcommand{\mydispositioncolor}{40,40,40}
%%\newcommand{\mydispositioncolor}{30,103,182}
%% e.g., "30,103,182" (blue/turquois), "0,0,0" (black), ...
%% Color of the headings and so forth in RGB (red,green,blue) values.
%% NOTE: if you are using "0,0,0" for black, printers might still
%%       recognize pages as color pages. In case this is a problem
%%       (paying for color print-outs vs. paying for b/w-printouts)
%%       please edit file "template/preamble.tex" and change
%%       "\definecolor{DispositionColor}{RGB}{\mydispositioncolor}"
%%       to "\definecolor{DispositionColor}{gray}{0}" and thus
%%       overwriting the value of \mydispositioncolor above.

\newcommand{\mycolorlinks}{true}  %% "true" or "false"
%% Enables or disables colored links (hyperref package).

%\newcommand{\mytitlepage}{template/title_Thesis_TU_Graz}

%% Your own or one of following pre-defined title pages:
%% "template/title_plain_maketitle": simple maketitle page
%% "template/title_Diplomarbeit_KF_Uni_Graz.tex": fancy (german) title page for KF Uni Graz
%% "template/title_Thesis_TU_Graz":
%%             titlepage for Graz University of Technology (correct
%%             (old?) Corporate Design) by Karl Voit (2012)
%% "template/title_Thesis_TU_Graz_-_kazemakase":
%%             titlepage for Graz University of Technology
%%             (correct new Corporate Design) by kazemakase (2013):
%%             see https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template/issues/5
%% "template/title_VWA": titlepage for Vorwissenschaftliche Arbeit

%% e.g., "" (empty), "disable", ...
%% Options for the todonotes-package. If "disable", all todonotes will
%% be hidden (including listoftodos).

%% Load main settings for document preamble:
\input{template/preamble}%% DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE!

\setboolean{myaddcolophon}{false}  %% "true" or "false"
%% If set to "true": a colophon (with notes about this document
%% template, LaTeX, ...) is added after the title page.
%% Please do not set to "false" without a good reason. The colophon
%% helps your readers to get in touch with LaTeX and to find this template.

\setboolean{english_affidavit}{true}  %% "true" or "false"
%% If set to "true": the language of the statutory declaration text is set to
%% English, otherwise it is in German.
